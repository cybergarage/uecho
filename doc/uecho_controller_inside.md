# Inside of uEcho Controller

## Node Profile Object

The controller is a special node of [ECHONETLite][enet] to control other nodes, but [ECHONETLite][enet] controller must have a following special node profile class object which has all children objects of the node [\[1\]][enet-spec].

- Class group code: 0x0E
- Class code: 0xF0
- Instance code: 0x01 (general node)

The uEcho added the node profile class objects automatically when the controller is created.
